# Technical Overview (Annotated)

This document provides the technical architecture and implementation specifications for the Ask Bender ("Z") platform, annotated with:
- **MVP NOTE:** Where implementation is intentionally simple for MVP
- **EDGE CASE:** Known complexities or risks
- **FUTURE:** Planned scalable or advanced features

---

# Mobile-First & Messaging-Only Philosophy

AskBender is designed from the ground up for a mobile-first, messaging-centric experience:

- **Contestants:** Interact exclusively via SMS and email (no web UI, no app downloads, zero friction).
- **Admins:** Use a mobile-optimized web dashboard (React PWA) for all management tasks.
- **Desktop:** Supported for admins, but not a design priority.
- **Future:** WhatsApp, Discord, and Slack integrations are planned for post-MVP phases.

This approach ensures maximum accessibility and simplicity for participants, while giving hosts powerful, touch-friendly tools.

# Best Practices: Handling User-Provided API Keys (MVP Approach)

## Overview
To allow Admin Users to use their own OpenAI (ChatGPT) API keys‚Äîand avoid platform-level billing for their usage‚ÄîAskBender supports user-provided API credentials. This section outlines best practices for securely handling these sensitive keys, with notes on MVP implementation and future scalability.

## MVP Implementation
- **User Entry:** Admins enter their OpenAI API key via a secure settings page in the admin dashboard.
- **Storage:**
  - API keys are stored encrypted at rest in the platform database (not as hashes, since the original value must be retrieved for API calls).
  - Encryption keys are managed via environment variables and never hardcoded.
  - API keys are never logged, displayed, or sent to the frontend after initial entry.
- **Usage:**
  - When an Admin triggers a ChatGPT action, the backend decrypts and uses their stored key for outbound API requests.
  - If the key is missing or invalid, the user is prompted to update it.
- **Access Control:**
  - Each Admin‚Äôs key is only used for their own requests.
  - Strict backend access controls prevent unauthorized access to stored keys.

## Edge Cases & Risks
- If the database or environment variables are compromised, encrypted keys could be at risk. Regularly rotate encryption keys and audit access.
- If an Admin‚Äôs OpenAI account is rate-limited or disabled, clear error messages are shown and the user is prompted to update their key.

## Future/Production Recommendations
- **Secrets Manager:** For production, migrate to a dedicated secrets manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault) for storing and managing API keys.
- **Key Rotation:** Implement regular key rotation and audit logging for all access to sensitive credentials.
- **Scalability:** Ensure the system can handle large numbers of Admin users and keys without performance or security degradation.

> **MVP NOTE:** The above approach is intentionally simple for MVP. Future releases should prioritize migration to a secrets manager and advanced access controls for production readiness.

## FUTURE: Hybrid Backend + LLM or Fine-Tuned Model for Scalable, Schema-Aware AI

- As the platform scales and tasks become more complex, migrate from pure prompt engineering to a hybrid approach:
  - Use the backend to maintain persistent knowledge of the schema, business rules, and user context.
  - Use the LLM for natural language understanding and ambiguous mapping tasks, but let the backend handle validation, mapping, and DB updates.
  - For even more automation, consider fine-tuning an LLM with your schema, business rules, and example mappings.
- This approach reduces token/context window issues, increases reliability, and allows for more advanced, system-aware AI features.
- See schema docs for additional notes on hybrid/fine-tuned approaches.

---

# Prompt Engineering for Schema-Aware Data Mapping (MVP)

## Example Prompt Template

When importing user data (e.g., from a spreadsheet), use a prompt like:

```
You are Bender, the AI assistant for AskBender.
Personality: witty, but professional in Funeral Mode.

Here is the relevant database schema for this Admin and Event:
[TABLE: participants]
- id (UUID)
- phone_number (String)
- email (String)
- group_id (UUID)
- nickname (String)
- ...

Here are the spreadsheet columns provided by the user:
- Phone
- Email
- Nickname

Task: Map each spreadsheet column to the correct database field for the current Admin and Event. Return a JSON object with the mapping, e.g.:
{
  "Phone": "phone_number",
  "Email": "email",
  "Nickname": "nickname"
}
If a column does not match any field, return null for that column.
```

## Best Practices for Backend Validation
- Always validate the LLM's output before updating the database:
  - Ensure all mapped fields exist in the schema and are allowed for the current Admin/Event.
  - Check for required fields and data types.
  - Log or flag any ambiguous or missing mappings for manual review.
- Never write directly to the DB based solely on LLM output‚Äîuse it as a suggestion, not an authority.
- For large imports, process data in batches and validate each batch.

## MVP NOTE
- This approach is sufficient for MVP-scale data and schema complexity.
- As the system grows, migrate to a hybrid backend+LLM approach as described above.

---

# Backend Validation Logic for LLM-Assisted Data Imports (MVP)

## Validation Steps
- Validate that all LLM-suggested mappings exist in the relevant schema for the current Admin/Event.
- Check that each spreadsheet column is mapped to a valid, allowed DB field.
- Flag or reject any mapping to non-existent or restricted fields.
- Confirm that unmapped columns are not required fields.
- For each row, validate required fields and data types.
- Check for constraint violations (e.g., unique, foreign key) before insert/update.
- Process data in batches; log and handle errors per row.
- Never write to the DB based solely on LLM output‚Äîonly after all validation checks pass.

## Example Validation Pseudocode
```
for row in spreadsheet_rows:
    mapped_row = {}
    for col, db_field in llm_mapping.items():
        if db_field is None:
            continue  # skip unmapped columns
        if db_field not in schema_fields:
            log_error(row, f"Invalid mapping: {col} -> {db_field}")
            continue
        value = row[col]
        if not validate_type(value, schema_fields[db_field].type):
            log_error(row, f"Type mismatch for {db_field}")
            continue
        mapped_row[db_field] = value
    if not all_required_fields_present(mapped_row, schema_fields):
        log_error(row, "Missing required fields")
        continue
    # Passed all checks, safe to insert/update
    db.insert_or_update(mapped_row)
```

## Security & Audit Notes
- Log all mapping and validation errors for troubleshooting and audit.
- Never write unvalidated or ambiguous data to the database.
- Optionally, provide an admin review interface for flagged rows.

## MVP NOTE
- This logic is sufficient for MVP-scale imports. As the system grows, enhance validation, error handling, and audit capabilities as needed.

---

# Logging & Monitoring for Admin API Key and LLM Data Imports (MVP)

## Requirements
- Log all API key entry, update, and validation attempts (never log the key itself).
- Log all LLM prompt requests and responses (with sensitive data redacted).
- Log all mapping and validation errors during data import.
- Log all successful and failed DB updates from imports.
- Monitor for repeated errors, suspicious activity, or system failures.
- (Optional) Provide an admin-accessible audit trail for critical actions.

## Example Log Structures

### API Key Actions
```
{
  "timestamp": "2025-07-22T12:34:56Z",
  "admin_user_id": "abc-123",
  "action": "api_key_update",
  "result": "success", // or "invalid_key", "error"
  "ip_address": "203.0.113.42"
}
```

### LLM Prompt/Response
```
{
  "timestamp": "2025-07-22T12:35:10Z",
  "admin_user_id": "abc-123",
  "event_id": "evt-456",
  "action": "llm_mapping_request",
  "prompt_summary": "Mapping 3 columns for Event X",
  "llm_response_status": "success", // or "error"
  "error_message": null // or error details
}
```

### Mapping/Validation Errors
```
{
  "timestamp": "2025-07-22T12:36:00Z",
  "admin_user_id": "abc-123",
  "event_id": "evt-456",
  "row_number": 17,
  "error_type": "invalid_mapping",
  "details": "Column 'PhoneNum' mapped to non-existent field 'phone_numbr'"
}
```

### DB Update Results
```
{
  "timestamp": "2025-07-22T12:36:30Z",
  "admin_user_id": "abc-123",
  "event_id": "evt-456",
  "action": "db_update",
  "row_number": 17,
  "result": "success" // or "validation_failed"
}
```

## Monitoring Recommendations
- Set up alerts for repeated API key failures, LLM errors, or high rates of import validation errors.
- Alert on suspicious activity (e.g., many failed key entries from one IP).
- Use dashboards (e.g., Grafana, Kibana, Datadog) to visualize import success/error rates and LLM usage.
- Maintain a searchable log of all admin actions related to API keys and data imports for compliance and troubleshooting.
- Retain logs for a reasonable period (e.g., 30-90 days for MVP).
- Never log sensitive data (API keys, full user data, etc.); redact or summarize prompts/responses as needed.

## MVP NOTE
- For MVP, simple file or DB-based logging is sufficient. As you scale, consider centralized logging and monitoring solutions (e.g., ELK stack, Datadog, AWS CloudWatch).

#### Fake Leaderboard Display
- After each question, at milestones, or on demand, system updates and displays a fake leaderboard using display_score.
- UI visually distinguishes between real and fake scores (if appropriate).
- Admin can configure when and how often the fake leaderboard is shown.

# Error Logging System Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Basic Error Logging (Current)
- Error boundary components for React error catching
- Global JavaScript error handlers
- Supabase error logging table for error storage
- User-friendly error message display
- Console logging for development debugging

## Phase 2: Enhanced Error Monitoring (Future)
- Real-time error monitoring dashboard
- Error aggregation and analytics
- Automatic error reporting to external services
- Error severity classification and routing
- Performance monitoring integration

## Enterprise Considerations
**REPLACE FOR ENTERPRISE:**
- Supabase error logging ‚Üí Enterprise logging service (Splunk, ELK Stack, etc.)
- Console logging ‚Üí Enterprise log aggregation (Datadog, New Relic, etc.)
- Basic error messages ‚Üí Localized, branded error handling
- Manual error tracking ‚Üí Automated error monitoring and alerting

## Development Notes
- All error logging code includes comments for enterprise replacement
- Error boundaries are component-specific for granular control
- Supabase integration is abstracted for easy replacement
- Console logging is development-only with production flags

## Technical Specifications

### Error Logging Architecture
```
User Action ‚Üí Error Boundary ‚Üí Error Handler ‚Üí Supabase Log ‚Üí User Feedback
```

### Error Categories
1. **UI Errors** - React component errors, rendering issues
2. **API Errors** - Network failures, authentication issues
3. **Validation Errors** - Form validation, data integrity
4. **System Errors** - Unexpected application failures

### Error Storage Schema
```sql
error_logs:
- id (uuid)
- user_id (uuid, nullable)
- error_type (string)
- error_message (text)
- stack_trace (text, nullable)
- component_name (string, nullable)
- user_agent (text)
- timestamp (timestamp)
- severity (string) - 'low', 'medium', 'high', 'critical'
- resolved (boolean, default false)
```

## Implementation Timeline
- **Week 1**: Basic error boundaries and handlers
- **Week 2**: Supabase integration and user feedback
- **Week 3**: Testing and refinement
- **Future**: Enterprise integration planning

## Security Considerations
- No sensitive user data in error logs
- Error messages sanitized for user display
- Log retention policies for compliance
- Access controls for error log viewing
